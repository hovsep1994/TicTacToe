Code sample for students.


Task 1.
Create class which should be responsible for the board of game.
It should store data of `X`s and `O`s and their positions 
The class should have a method to accept player moves.
Give a method to check if the game is finished, etc.


Task 2.
Create class which should read playerâ€™s input data.
After each move the board must be printed in terminal.
When the game is finished the winner should be printed in terminal
In the end of game each players move counts must printed

Task 3. 
The size of the board must be configurable
	At the beginning of the game player sets the size of the board (e.g. 3x3 or 5x5)
	And also player sets as a configuration the winning condition (e.g. 3 or 5) this means if there are 3 of Xs in a raw player X wins the game


<b>Task 4.</b>
In case of invalid input from players the game must not be interrupted.
User must be asked for retry with a cause.


Advice: Create separate classes for separate logical sections. 
	  Tabulation, variable, class, method names are really important 
	  Players must to be informed that they must type something with a nice message
	  Generally more readable the code is more point you will get
